## Netflix Visualization Project Description
https://451488975.github.io/projects/final-project  

As one of the most popular movie and tv shows streaming platforms, Netflix provides us with countless entertaining content to watch during every movie night. But have you ever thought about these questions when watching movies or tv shows on Netflix:  
What is the average score of the movies in different years?  
Which genre has the most restrict-rated content so I can avoid watching it with my children?  
Our project would help you answer these questions and hope we can give you a better understanding of some of the data behind Netflix.  

We used bar charts and interactive heatmaps to display the data which may help audiences have more insight of the resources Netflix provides.
